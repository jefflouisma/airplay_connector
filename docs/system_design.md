## Implementation approach
We will use Flask as our web framework due to its simplicity and flexibility. Flask-SocketIO will be used for real-time communication between the server and the web-based user interface. For the audio processing and transmission, we will use the PyDub library and shairport-sync, an open-source AirPlay audio player. The web interface will be built using Bootstrap for a responsive, modern design. The application will be packaged and distributed as a Docker container for easy deployment on a Raspberry Pi.

## Python package name
```python
"airplay_streamer"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "audio_processor.py",
    "web_interface.py",
    "config_manager.py",
    "Dockerfile"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Main{
        +Flask app
        +SocketIO socketio
        +void run()
    }
    class AudioProcessor{
        +PyDub audio
        +void start_streaming()
        +void stop_streaming()
    }
    class WebInterface{
        +Bootstrap ui
        +void update_ui()
    }
    class ConfigManager{
        +dict config
        +void load_config()
        +void save_config()
    }
    Main "1" -- "1" AudioProcessor: controls
    Main "1" -- "1" WebInterface: controls
    Main "1" -- "1" ConfigManager: uses
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant A as AudioProcessor
    participant W as WebInterface
    participant C as ConfigManager
    M->>C: load_config()
    M->>W: update_ui()
    M->>A: start_streaming()
    Note over M,A: User starts streaming
    M->>A: stop_streaming()
    Note over M,A: User stops streaming
    M->>C: save_config()
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
