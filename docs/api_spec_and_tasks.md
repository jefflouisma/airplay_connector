## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("config_manager.py", "Contains the ConfigManager class which is responsible for loading and saving the application configuration."),
    ("audio_processor.py", "Contains the AudioProcessor class which handles the audio streaming."),
    ("web_interface.py", "Contains the WebInterface class which controls the user interface."),
    ("main.py", "Contains the Main class which controls the application flow and integrates all other components."),
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "config_manager.py",
    "audio_processor.py",
    "web_interface.py",
    "main.py",
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'config_manager.py' contains the 'config' dictionary which stores the application configuration. This configuration is loaded at the start of the application and saved when the application is stopped.

'audio_processor.py' uses the 'audio' object from the PyDub library for audio processing and the 'start_streaming' and 'stop_streaming' methods to control the audio streaming.

'web_interface.py' uses the 'ui' object from the Bootstrap library to control the user interface. The 'update_ui' method is used to update the user interface.

'main.py' uses the 'app' object from the Flask library and the 'socketio' object from the Flask-SocketIO library for the web server and real-time communication. The 'run' method starts the application.
